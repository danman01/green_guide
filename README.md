## 1. Home<a id='1'></a>
Things to do at home

### 1.1. Energy usage
Take note of your KwH usage on your current electric bill, and see how much it goes down after making some energy efficiency improvements

- [ ] use dryer sparingly - only when your significant other _really_ needs their sheets warm and fluffed
- [ ] energy efficient lightbulbs
- [ ] don't leave a TV on in the background, or for your dog / cat while you are away.
- [ ] fans in rooms instead of using air conditioner, when temperatures inside are ~ < 80-85 degrees
- [ ] close blinds during the days: open / close east, south and west as the sun moves
- [ ] get solar - yes it is a big cost, but calculate payback time...you may be losing money by not going solar
- [ ] upgrade your heating system - another big cost -- what's the payback time? can you get off of oil / fossil fuels for heat while saving money over the long term?
- [ ] energy assessment - many states will do this for free and give rebates / discounts on needed upgrades
- [ ] add insulation 
- [ ] upgrade to energy star appliances
- [ ] thermostat on timer and schedule so you aren't heating / cooling spaces that aren't being used
- [ ] empty and unplug the extra freezer / fridge that many households have. If you can do without the extra storage...even for a few days or weeks at a time.

### 1.2. Lawn & Garden
Create a natural environment that requires minimum input and produces zero waste or chemical runoff

- [ ] stop spraying chemicals on your lawn
- [ ] stop watering grass
- [ ] Start a garden or at least grow a few herbs in pots
- [ ] Get some chickens. They will eat food scraps and give you eggs

### 1.3. Household waste
Take ownership of all household waste. See how many bags of trash you throw out in a week / month, and have a goal to reduce this over time.

- [ ] Start a compost and divert all food waste to compost
- [ ] Recycle
- [ ] Freecycle / facebook marketplace / craigslist usable items
